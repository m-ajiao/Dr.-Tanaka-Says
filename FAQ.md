## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why are these posters addressed specifically to fansubbers?

Chinese fansubbers are a under-exposed group of people to digital privacy and security. It is necessary to teach them about privacy, security and anonymity, but everyone who wants to communicate privately and securely on the Internet can make use of the information presented in the tutorials.

### Does this project promote stealing?

No. This project is designed to facilitate private and secure communication and file sharing between friends and community members. This project is intended to educate the under-represented groups in digital privacy and security about how to stay safe on the Internet.
